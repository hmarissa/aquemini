                <p>
                    "Baby, did you hear that?" "Yeah, baby, I heard it too"<br>
                    Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue<br>
                    Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you<br>
                    Raining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue<br>
                    Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on<br>
                    I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon ("Hello?")<br>
                    This Dre, bring the MP and the SP<br>
                    Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully<br>
                    Baby, grab the baby, 'cause baby, it ain't much time<br>
                    Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign<br>
                </p>

            <section>
                <p>
                    Omega, nigga, I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur<br>
                    Hope I'm not over your head, but if so, you will catch on later<br>
                    Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'<br>
                    Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'<br>
                    From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her<br>
                    Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done<br>
                </p>

                    <p>
                    The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns<br>
                    For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won<br>
                    Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family<br>
                    I drove the biggest thing in the house 'cause I knew they'd try to ram me<br>
                    But I'm stabbing, making a path on expressway the best way I know how<br>
                    Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds<br>
                    Him coming now, fuck that money now<br>
                    I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? "Yeah, yeah, she chillin'"<br>
                    We should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?<br>
                    Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies<br>
                    But I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya<br>
                    I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California<br>
                    All the weed smell like ammonia, but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking<br>
                    Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording<br>
                    Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion<br>
                    The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion<br>
