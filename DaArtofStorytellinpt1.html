            <p><em>Aquemini</em> is OutKast's third studio album, released on September 29, 1998. The album title represents Big Boi and André 3000's personalities by combining their Zodiac signs: Aquarius and Gemini.</p>
            <p> Expanding on the outer space-inspired sounds of the duo’s previous record (<em>ATLiens</em>), <em>Aquemini</em> incorporates influences of 1970s funk, southern soul, gospel, country, psychedelic rock, and more. It explores various themes lyrically — including individuality, human nature, addiction, self-inflicted struggles, technology, and relationships — while blending together science fiction concepts and urban narratives.</p>

                <p>Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous</p>
                <p>Was it the b*tch that f*cked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?</p>
                <p>Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot</p>
                <p>Makin' a n*gga hit that chonk at legitimate spots</p>
                <p>Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature</p>
                <p>Had to hate ya, playa</p>
                <p>I'm d*ckin' the ho down — never said I paid her</p>
                <p>Straight laid her, slayed the b*tch like Darth Vader, made her</p>
                <p>From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur</p>
                <p>Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty — that was shawty</p>
                <p>Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840</p>

                <p>But I still wanna cut her, though — maybe she had to work?</p>
                <p>I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt</p>
                <p> She was fine as f*ck — I wanted to sex the ho up</p>
                <p> She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"</p>
                <p>I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do</p>
                <p>I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too"</p>
                <p>She said she understood and everythin' was kosher</p>
                <p>I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a f*ckin' poster</p>

                <p>Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer</p>
