                <h2>[Verse 1: Big Boi]</h2>
                <p>Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous</p>
                <p>Was it the b*tch that f*cked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?</p>
                <p>Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot</p>
                <p>Makin' a n*gga hit that chonk at legitimate spots</p>
                <p>Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature</p>
                <p>Had to hate ya, playa</p>
                <p>I'm d*ckin' the ho down — never said I paid her</p>
                <p>Straight laid her, slayed the b*tch like Darth Vader, made her</p>
                <p>From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur</p>
                <p>Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty — that was shawty</p>
                <p>Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840</p>
            </section>
            <section id="two">
                <p>It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me</p>
                <p>My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me</p>
                <p>But I still wanna cut her, though — maybe she had to work?</p>
                <p>I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt</p>
                <p> She was fine as f*ck — I wanted to sex the ho up</p>
                <p> She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"</p>
                <p>I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do</p>
                <p>I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too"</p>
                <p>She said she understood and everythin' was kosher</p>
                <p>I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a f*ckin' poster</p>
                <p>It's like that, now</p>

                <p>It's like that, now</p>
                <p>You better go on and get the hump up out your back now</p>
                <p>It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now</p>
                <p>We just shoot game in the form of story raps now (Yeah)</p>
                <p>It's like that now, it's like that now</p>

                <h2>[Verse 2: André 3000]</h2>
                <p>Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha... Thumper</p>
                <p>I remember her number like the summer</p>
                <p>When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber</p>
                <p>Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer</p>
                <p>Well, it was more like spend the night</p>
                <p>Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights</p>
                <p>We chillin' like a villain, and a n*gga feelin' right</p>
                <p>In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite all of the bullsh*t</p>
            </section>
            <section id="five">
                <p>We on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)</p>
                <p>Talkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)</p>
                <p>I said, "What you wanna be?" She said, "Alive"</p>
                <p>It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes</p>
                <p>I coulda died, time went on, I got grown</p>
                <p>Rhyme got strong, mind got blown</p>
                <p>I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone</p>
                <p>Her mama said she with a n*gga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)</p>
                <p>I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show</p>
                <p>That I would one day see her standin' in the front row</p>
                <p>But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school</p>
                <p>With a needle in her arm, baby two months due</p>
                <p>Sasha Thumper</p>
