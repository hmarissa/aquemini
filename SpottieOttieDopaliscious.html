                    Leanin', checking out the scene<br>
                    Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit<br>
                    Ridin' out, talkin' shit<br>
                    Nigga, where you wanna go?<br>
                    You know the club don't close 'til four<br>
                    Let's party 'til we can't no more<br>

                    As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles<br>
                    A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA<br>
                    Via Atlanta, Georgia<br>
                    A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life<br>
                    Me? Well, I've never been there<br>
                    Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door<br>
                    You speak of hardcore<br>

                While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day<br>
                While this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear<br>
                Competing with "Set It Off" in the right<br>
                But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it<br>
                "Hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!"<br>
                And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight<br>

                But in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up<br>
                Two niggas done started busting—"Wham! Wham!"<br>
                And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, "Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?"<br>
                It's just my interpretation of the situation<br>
