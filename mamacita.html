            <p><em>Aquemini</em> is OutKast's third studio album, released on September 29, 1998. The album title represents Big Boi and André 3000's personalities by combining their Zodiac signs: Aquarius and Gemini.</p>
            <p> Expanding on the outer space-inspired sounds of the duo’s previous record (<em>ATLiens</em>), <em>Aquemini</em> incorporates influences of 1970s funk, southern soul, gospel, country, psychedelic rock, and more. It explores various themes lyrically — including individuality, human nature, addiction, self-inflicted struggles, technology, and relationships — while blending together science fiction concepts and urban narratives.</p>
